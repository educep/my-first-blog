Creating an application
from djangogirls directory where manage.py file is:
Mac OS X and Linux:
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py startapp blog
Windows:
(myvenv) C:\Users\Name\djangogirls> python manage.py startapp blog

In  mysite/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS
add blog

Creating a blog post model

blog/models.py file we define all objects called Models 
 if you want to know more about Model fields and how to define things other than those described above (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/fields/#field-types).

 Create tables for models in your database
The last step here is to add our new model to our database. First we have to make Django know that we have some changes in our model. (We have just created it!) Go to your console window and type python manage.py makemigrations blog. It will look like this:

command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py makemigrations blog
Migrations for 'blog':
  blog/migrations/0001_initial.py:
  - Create model Post

  Django prepared a migration file for us that we now have to apply to our database. Type python manage.py migrate blog and the output should be as follows:

command-line
(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ 

Django admin:

As you can see, we import (include) the Post model defined in the previous chapter. To make our model visible on the admin page, we need to register the model with admin.site.register(Post).

 - ---TEST --
To log in, you need to create a superuser - a user account that has control over everything on the site. Go back to the command line, type 
python manage.py createsuperuser
 and press enter.

 If you want to know more about Django admin, you should check Django's documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/contrib/admin/

 DEPLOY
 Install Git 
 all default options except for:
 "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (the bottom option).

Initilise an empty repository
 You should be in the djangogirls folder.

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/djangogirls/.git/
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email you@example.com

Git will track changes to all the files and folders in this directory, but there are some files we want it to ignore. We do this by creating a file called .gitignore in the base directory

we save our changes. Go to your console and run these commands:

command-line
$ git add --all .
$ git commit -m "My Django Girls app, first commit"
 [...]
 13 files changed, 200 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 [...]
 create mode 100644 mysite/wsgi.py

repository github:
 https://github.com/educep/my-first-blog.git

 Now we need to hook up the Git repository on your computer to the one up on GitHub.

Type the following into your console (Replace <your-github-username> with the username you entered when you created your GitHub account, but without the angle-brackets):

command-line
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/my-first-blog.git
$ git push -u origin master

pythonanywhere
obtain token

in console bach de pythonanywhere

install pythonanywhere
install --user pythonanywhere

we need to initialize the admin account with createsuperuser. PythonAnywhere has automatically activated your virtualenv for you, so all you need to do is run:

PythonAnywhere command-line
(ola.pythonanywhere.com) $ python manage.py createsuperuser

URLS
Una vez hechotodo eso, hay que crear un url, ver a qué se parecen los urls en djando en :
mysirt\urls.py
we will import URLs from our blog application to the main mysite/urls.py file.
Go ahead, add a line that will import blog.urls. Note that we are using the include function here so you will need to add that import.

Your mysite/urls.py file should now look like this:

mysite/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import include
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'', include('blog.urls')),
]

 ------  blog.urls  ----------
Create a new empty file named urls.py in the blog directory. All right! Add these first two lines:

blog/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.post_list, name='post_list'),
]

-------- Django views ---------

blog/views.py
def post_list(request):
    return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {})

----- templates ----------

emplates are saved in blog/templates/blog directory. So first create a directory called templates inside your blog directory. Then create another directory called blog inside your templates directory

----------- Deploy!  ------------

git status
git add --all .
git status
git commit -m "Changed the HTML for the site."
git push

PythonAnywhere command-line
$ cd ~/<your-pythonanywhere-username>.pythonanywhere.com
$ git pull

----------  Django ORM and QuerySets  -------------
A QuerySet is, in essence, a list of objects of a given Model. QuerySets allow you to read the data from the database, filter it and order it.

in local shell:
python manage.py shell
You're now in Django's interactive console. It's just like the Python prompt, but with some additional Django magic. :) You can use all the Python commands here too, of course.

display all of our posts:
from blog.models import Post
Post.objects.all()
Create object


This is how you create a new Post object in database:

command-line
>>> Post.objects.create(author=me, title='Sample title', text='Test')
me = an user
To know who are my site's users:
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.all()
me = User.objects.get(username='ola')
Post.objects.all()

 ---------- Filter objects  -------------
Post.objects.filter(author=me)
Post.objects.filter(title__contains='title')  # attention double under score
from django.utils import timezone
Post.objects.filter(published_date__lte=timezone.now()) # to publish a post: 
			post = Post.objects.get(title="Sample title")
			post.publish()

# ---------------------------
Ordering objects
Chaining QuerySets			
# ---------------------------

----------------- Dynamic data in templates ------------------
To see in the site the post we need to "connect" model (posts) with views (the html visualized)
Remember when we talked about including code written in different files? Now is the moment when we have to include the model we have written in models.py. We will add the line from .models import Post like this:

blog/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

publishing posts in html-------------

Python variables in html {{ variable_name}} (double brakets)
ex:
{{post}}
publishes: <QuerySet [<Post: title1>, <Post: title2>, <Post: uruguay>, <Post: Sample title>]>


GIT pulling ignoring local changes
git reset --hard
git pull

 -------------- Make UP for the blog (improving the looks): --------------
 install Bootstrap
 To install Bootstrap, you need to add this to your <head> in your .html file:

blog/templates/blog/post_list.html


Where to put static files for Django
Django already knows where to find the static files for the built-in "admin" app. Now we just need to add some static files for our own app, blog.

We do that by creating a folder called static inside the blog app:

djangogirls
├── blog
│   ├── migrations
│   ├── static
│   └── templates
└── mysite

We really recommend taking this free online Codeacademy HTML & CSS course. It can help you learn all about making your websites prettier with CSS.

add "h1 a" change color to blog.css


We also need to tell our HTML template that we added some CSS. Open the blog/templates/blog/post_list.html file and add this line at the very beginning of it:
{% static 'css/blog.css' %} antes de todo
blog/templates/blog/post_list.html in head

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/blog.css' %}">
